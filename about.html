    <h2> What's a Pug? </h2>


  <p1> A Pug is a very distinctive breed of dog. With its classic squished face and wrinkled breadloaf body,
    it has become a favorite of many across the world. </p1>

    <p2> The breed originally hails from China, and was considered the main companion of ancient Chinese Emporers,
      they eventually made their way over to Holland serving as the mascot for their royal House of Orange. Today,
      they are a breed that we see walking down the street all the time.</p2>

      <p3> While typically seen in the 'fawn' color, Pugs can also come in Black, Silver Fawn and Apricot.
        They have a glossy short coat and grow to be 10-12 inches high at adult size. </p3>

      <h4> Temperament </h4>
        Pugs are very sociable, playful and quiet- making them great family dogs. They can be stubborn, but with the
        right training they can become the perfect pet.
